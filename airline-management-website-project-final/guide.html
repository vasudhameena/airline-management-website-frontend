            <p>Weight and Size
                Carry-on baggage allowance can vary according to the airline, the cabin class you are traveling in and even the size of the aircraft. As a general guide, carry-on baggage should have maximum length of 22 in (56 cm), width of 18 in (45 cm) and depth of 10 in (25 cm). These dimensions include wheels, handles, side pockets, etc.
                
                Some airlines also enforce weight limitations, typically starting at 5kg/11lbs.
                
                To avoid additional charges, please check with your airline before you travel so that you are fully aware of the carry-on baggage allowance included with your airfare.
                
                If you are using different airlines throughout your journey, you should check their individual websites for up to date information regarding carry-on baggage allowances.
                
                Portable Electronic Devices & Lithium Batteries
                Lithium batteries in portable devices can pose a fire risk if not safely handled and packed correctly.  If you are traveling with spare batteries, electronic cigarettes/vapes or back-up power supply (power banks) and most other portable electronic devices, you must carry them in your carry-on baggage and not checked baggage. Any spare batteries must be individually wrapped to prevent short circuit.
                
                > Read our detailed guidance for using electronic devices safely onboard (pdf).
                
                Sharp Objects
                All knives, sharp objects or cutting implements of any kind and of any length, whether of metal or other material, and some sporting goods must be packed in checked baggage. They cannot be carried in the cabin baggage nor on your person.</p>
